      <h2>The untold story of Mahendra Singh Dhoni's journey from ticket collector to trophy collector - the world-cup-winning captain of the Indian Cricket Team.</h2>
      <p class="journey">Mahendra Singh Dhoni or MS Dhoni is one of the most popular Indian cricketers. Putting his great leadership skills to test, he served as the former captain of the Indian national cricket team; however, he captained the team
        only in
        limited-overs format from 2007 to 2016, and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Also known for his excellent wicket-keeping skills, he was a gem to the Indian team even in some very hard situations. He made his debut in One Day International
        (ODI) in December 2004, playing against Bangladesh. A year later, he debuted in test cricket against Sri Lanka. He is known by some as one of the best wicket-keepers in modern limited-overs international cricket.
        Dhoni was born on July 7, 1981 in Ranchi, Bihar (now Jharkhand) to Pan Singh and Devaki Devi. He has a sister Jayanti and a brother Narendra Singh Dhoni. Originally his family belonged to village Lvali in the Lamgarha block of Almora district
        of Uttarakhand. He studied at the DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir School in Shyamali, Ranchi, Jharkhand. Initially, during his school days, he used to play badminton and football and in fact was the goalkeeper of his football team. Once he was sent
        by his football coach to play cricket for a local cricket club. It was in this match that he impressed everyone with his wicket-keeping skills which resulted in getting him a regular post of the wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club
        (1995-1998). He was picked up for the Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well. Dhoni focused on cricket after passing his 10th standard. From 2001 to 2003, he worked as a Train Ticket Examiner (TTE) at the Kharagpur
        Railway Station under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.</p>
